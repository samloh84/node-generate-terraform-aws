and security group and network ACLs from defined traffic rules between the network tiers. 

## Installation

2. Use NPM to install the dependencies required for this script.

## AWS VPC Limits
Do note that AWS VPC imposes limits on the number of security groups and network ACLs, as well as the number of inbound and outbound rules in each security group or network ACL.
The generated resources may exceed these limits, so modify your configuration accordingly.
